# Render strategy (step 7)

#### Confirm Visual Direction with User (DO THIS FIRST)

Before you start designing cards or deciding bounds, **ask the user to
pick the output ratio, the layout, the style, and the card-density
preset**. Frames are auto-selected from the chosen layout × style
combination (see "Auto-pick frame" table below). Before sending the
question, **precompute two things**:

1. **`recommendedRatio`** from the source video's aspect ratio
   (`metadata.json` width / height):
   - `sourceAspect = width / height`
   - `sourceAspect ≥ 1.5` (≥ ~3:2 wide) → recommend **`16:9`**
   - `sourceAspect ≤ 0.7` (≤ ~9:13 tall) → recommend **`9:16`**
   - `0.7 < sourceAspect < 1.5` (near-square) → recommend **`4:5`**

   Mark the recommended option's label with " (recommended · matches source video X:Y)"
   so the user sees why it's recommended.

2. **`autoCount`** from Step 6 (`max(5, round(videoSec / (basePace ×
densityMultiplier)))`) so the "auto" option's label can show the
   concrete number.

**Environment compatibility — pick the best available question channel.**
Not every runtime exposes the same structured-question tool. Apply this
order:

1. **`AskUserQuestion`** (Claude Code, Anthropic Console) — use the
   structured 4-question call below.
2. **Other native clarification tool** (e.g. `ask_question`,
   `request_user_input`, IDE-specific prompt) — use that tool with the
   same 4 question texts and option lists. Preserve the recommendation
   markers and the precomputed values.
3. **No native tool** (Codex CLI, plain text-only runtimes) — **ask
   directly in normal conversation**. Use the plain-text template at the
   end of this section. Keep it to **one message, 4 numbered questions**
   (the global cap is 2–5 questions per round; we stay inside it).

Rules that apply to every channel:

- Ask **at most 2–5 questions per round**. Our 4 here fits.
- Even if missing info doesn't block rendering, **ask once to confirm
  the parameters that materially affect the final output** (ratio,
  layout, style, cardCount).
- If the user has already pre-approved defaults ("just use defaults",
  "no need to ask", "auto-pick everything"), asked you not to ask, or the
  run carries an ongoing autonomous signal ("surprise me" / "decide for me" —
  `../hyperframes-core/references/brief-contract.md` § 1) — **skip
  the question entirely** and use: `recommendedRatio`, `layout="stack"`
  (safest cross-ratio default), `style` chosen from transcript tone in
  the most neutral group (editorial/data), `autoCount`. Tell the user
  what you picked in one sentence and continue.

**Channel A — native `AskUserQuestion`:**

```
// Precompute before the call:
//   recommendedRatio = "16:9" | "9:16" | "4:5"
//   autoCount        = integer (from Step 6)

AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Output video aspect ratio (canvas):",
      header: "Aspect ratio",
      multiSelect: false,
      // Reorder so the recommended option appears FIRST (per AskUserQuestion convention).
      // Append " (recommended · matches source video W×H)" to the recommended option's label.
      options: [
        { label: "16:9 (1920×1080) landscape", description: "TV / YouTube / desktop playback. Most natural when the source video is already landscape; widest canvas." },
        { label: "9:16 (1080×1920) portrait", description: "TikTok / Reels / short-form mobile. Most natural for portrait source; native mobile experience." },
        { label: "4:5 (1080×1350) near-portrait", description: "Instagram feed / WeChat Moments. Best when source is near-square or you want to cover both platforms." }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Choose the overall layout: how should the video and cards coexist on the canvas?",
      header: "Layout",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        { label: "side-by-side (split)",  description: "Video and card each take half the canvas. Most stable for interview / data side-by-side; clear visual separation." },
        { label: "top-bottom (stack)",    description: "Video on top (~52%), card below. Classic combo of speaker face + summary card; works well in portrait too." },
        { label: "picture-in-picture (pip)", description: "Card fills the canvas, video shrinks to a rounded corner window. Use when content is primary and speaker is secondary." },
        { label: "full-screen overlay (overlay)", description: "Video plays full-bleed, card floats as a glass layer on top. Strong cinematic / emotional feel." }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Choose the card visual style (style):",
      header: "Style group",
      multiSelect: false,
      // NOTE: these 3 groups intentionally match the frame auto-pick matrix
      // rows below, so picking a group resolves both `style` group AND the
      // frame matrix column in one step. Memberships are mutually exclusive.
      options: [
        { label: "warm paper (warm-paper)", description: "academic notebook · editorial big-type · whiteboard hand-drawn · xhs social. Best for interview reflections, product launches, lifestyle, emotional stories." },
        { label: "clinical / cold (clinical)",   description: "audit magazine · swiss grid · terminal CLI · minimal modern. Best for financial analysis, investigative reports, technical tutorials, serious presentations." },
        { label: "experimental / avant-garde (experimental)", description: "geom color-clash geometry · spotlight dark-background. Best for short-form highlights, product launches, strong emotion, cinematic feel." }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Card count (takeaway pacing): how many cards to cut?",
      header: "Card count",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        { label: "Auto (recommended) · approx N cards", description: "Inferred automatically from video duration and information density (see Step 6 rules). This run estimates approx N cards. Substitute the real N (your autoCount) into the label." },
        { label: "Fewer · approx round(N × 0.6) cards", description: "Sparser cuts, each card holds longer — suits reflective / slow-paced content." },
        { label: "More · approx round(N × 1.5) cards", description: "Tighter cuts, faster rhythm — suits staccato / data-dense / short-form highlight content." }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**About "Other"** — `AskUserQuestion` automatically adds an "Other" option to the card count question. The user can type a number directly (e.g. "8", "20") as the cardCount target. Parse the input as an integer: if parsing succeeds → use that value (minimum 5 as a floor); if parsing fails → fall back to "auto".

**Channel B — plain-text fallback** (Codex CLI, runtimes without a
native question tool). Post this as one normal message, then wait for
the reply. Bullet-style 1/2/3/4 keeps the reply parseable:

```
I need to confirm four visual decisions with you before I start cutting cards:

1) Output aspect ratio (canvas):
   A. 16:9 landscape (1920×1080) — TV / YouTube / desktop playback
   B. 9:16 portrait (1080×1920) — TikTok / Reels / short-form mobile
   C. 4:5 near-portrait (1080×1350) — Instagram feed / works for both platforms
   ▸ My recommendation:  <recommendedRatio>  (matches source video W×H = <sourceW>×<sourceH>)

2) Overall layout (how video & card coexist):
   A. split   side-by-side (50/50)
   B. stack   top-bottom (video top, card bottom)
   C. pip     picture-in-picture (card full canvas, video rounded corner window)
   D. overlay full-screen glass overlay (video full-bleed, card glass layer)

3) Card style group (maps to frame auto-pick matrix, pick 1 of 3):
   A. warm paper (warm-paper)      (academic / editorial / whiteboard / xhs)
   B. clinical / cold (clinical)   (audit / swiss / terminal / minimal)
   C. experimental (experimental)  (geom / spotlight)

4) Card count (takeaway pacing):
   A. Auto (recommended) — approx <autoCount> cards
   B. Fewer — approx round(<autoCount> × 0.6) cards
   C. More — approx round(<autoCount> × 1.5) cards
   D. Give me a specific number (e.g. "8", "20")

Reply format: "1A 2C 3B 4A" or natural language is fine.
If you want all recommended defaults, reply "default" / "auto" / "use all recommendations".
```

Parsing the plain-text reply:

- Accept loose formats: `"1A 2C 3B 4A"`, `"A C B A"`, `"16:9 / pip /
data / auto"`, full sentences, or `default`.
- If any answer is ambiguous → re-ask only the ambiguous ones (still
  inside the 2–5 cap).
- If the user says "default / auto / use all recommendations" → skip without re-asking.

After the user answers (any channel):

1. **Resolve the output canvas** from the ratio answer — these are the
   exact `storyboard.composition.width / height` values to write:

   | user choice | composition.width × height | storyboard.layout field                                       |
   | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `16:9`      | **1920 × 1080**            | `"landscape"`                                                 |
   | `9:16`      | **1080 × 1920**            | `"portrait"`                                                  |
   | `4:5`       | **1080 × 1350**            | `"portrait"` (schema treats 4:5 as portrait — height > width) |

   For **4:5 bounds inside `references/layouts/*.html`** — those files
   only document landscape (1920×1080) and portrait (1080×1920). For
   4:5 (1080×1350) derive bounds by **proportional scaling from
   portrait**: keep horizontal values, scale vertical values by
   `1350/1920 ≈ 0.703`. Example: `overlay` portrait card =
   `{ x: 24, y: 1280, w: 1032, h: 564 }` → 4:5 card =
   `{ x: 24, y: round(1280 × 0.703), w: 1032, h: round(564 × 0.703) }`
   = `{ x: 24, y: 900, w: 1032, h: 397 }`.

2. **Map the style group to a specific style** by looking at the
   transcript tone — pick the one that best fits, but stay inside the
   user's chosen group. If you're unsure between two specific styles
   inside the group, send a second `AskUserQuestion` with those 2–4
   specific style options.

3. **Resolve final cardCount** from the density answer:

   | user choice             | final cardCount                           |
   | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
   | Auto (recommended)      | the `autoCount` you already computed      |
   | Fewer                   | `max(5, round(autoCount × 0.6))`          |
   | More                    | `round(autoCount × 1.5)` (no upper clamp) |
   | Other = "<n>" (integer) | `max(5, parseInt(n))`                     |
   | Other = anything else   | fall back to `autoCount`                  |

4. **Auto-pick the video frame** from this table (frames don't ask the
   user — they follow from layout × style):

   | layout    | warm-paper styles (academic / whiteboard / editorial / xhs) | clinical styles (audit / swiss / terminal / minimal) | experimental styles (geom / spotlight) |
   | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | `split`   | `polaroid`                                                  | `hairline`                                           | `clean`                                |
   | `stack`   | `polaroid`                                                  | `hairline`                                           | `clean`                                |
   | `pip`     | `clean` (pip pill already has chrome)                       | `clean`                                              | `clean`                                |
   | `overlay` | `clean` (full-bleed forbids deco frames)                    | `clean`                                              | `clean`                                |

5. **Tell the user what you chose** in one sentence — ratio (+ canvas
   size), layout, specific style, frame, and final cardCount — then
   proceed with the rest of Step 7 (per-card layouts, motion patterns).
6. Record the five values (ratio / layout / style / frame / cardCount)
   in working memory (no schema field needed); you'll reference them
   while writing each card's HTML in Step 8 and while reading the
   matching `references/<dim>/<key>.html` for tokens and structure.

If the user picks an answer via "Other" with a free-text style name not
in the 10-style library, treat it as a hint to design a fresh card
visual yourself, but still anchor on the chosen layout's bounds.

#### Render Strategy Inputs

With ratio / layout / style / cardCount / frame locked from Step 7.0,
the remaining per-card decisions are:

- **Source-video fit inside the GSAP target**: video element has
  `object-fit: cover` and is clipped to `#video-wrap`'s tween bounds.
  If you want NO cropping (e.g. portrait source on landscape canvas
  shouldn't get its top/bottom chopped), aim the tween at a rect that
  matches the source's aspect ratio and let surrounding canvas show
  through (or fill with the card / a backdrop).
- **`card.zone` per card**: derive from your chosen composition layout
  (split → side-panel, stack → lower-third, pip → fullscreen, overlay
  → video-overlay), OR pick a different zone for one-off variants
  (fullscreen for hero / quote, whiteboard-area for dense data).
- **`accentIndex` per card**: each card pulls one of the 5 theme accent
  colors. Vary across cards for rhythm; reuse the same index when two
  cards belong to the same narrative beat.
- **Motion vocabulary**: pick 2–3 repeatable patterns from
  `data-anim` kinds (see the table later) and stick to them so the
  composition feels coherent.

Pick from these `themeId` palettes (use them as `--accent-N` /
`--bg` / `--text` CSS variables in your composition `<style>` block):

| themeId | accent palette (5 colors)                 | board bg          | text      |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| classic | `#1971c2 #e03131 #2f9e44 #e8590c #9c36b5` | `#FFF9E3` (paper) | `#1e1e1e` |
| noir    | `#4cc9f0 #f72585 #4ade80 #fb923c #a78bfa` | `#1a1a1a`         | `#f1f1f1` |
| mint    | `#0077b6 #d62828 #2d6a4f #e76f51 #7209b7` | `#e8faf0`         | `#1b4332` |
| craft   | `#bf5700 #d62728 #6c757d #e9b54a #3d5a80` | `#f6efe1`         | `#2d2d2d` |
| slate   | `#0ea5e9 #ef4444 #22c55e #f97316 #a855f7` | `#1e293b`         | `#f1f5f9` |
| mono    | `#000 #555 #888 #aaa #ccc`                | `#fff`            | `#000`    |

Available fonts (woff2 in `<SKILL_DIR>/assets/fonts/`, staged to work dir in Step 9): `Caveat` (handwriting),
`LXGW WenKai TC` (Chinese hand-script), `Inter` (modern sans), `Virgil`
(geometric hand). Reference via `@font-face` or `font-family` directly.

For inspiration on visual patterns, `<SKILL_DIR>/references/styles/`
ships 10 self-contained reference cards (academic / editorial / minimal
/ spotlight / geom / whiteboard / audit / terminal / swiss / xhs) that
you can copy as starting points — but **do not feel constrained to
match any of these**. Each card is your own design.

#### Visual Design Library (<SKILL_DIR>/references/)

Beyond the composition-level `themeId`, the skill ships a richer **reference
library** at `<SKILL_DIR>/references/` covering three **orthogonal**
visual dimensions you can freely mix:

```
Style  ×  Layout  ×  VideoFrame
 (10)      (4)         (3)
```

| dimension  | keys                                                                                              | what it decides                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **style**  | `academic` `editorial` `minimal` `spotlight` `geom` `whiteboard` `audit` `terminal` `swiss` `xhs` | the card's visual language — fonts, colors, ornament, layout-within-card |
| **layout** | `split` `stack` `pip` `overlay`                                                                   | how the source video and the card share the canvas                       |
| **frame**  | `clean` `hairline` `polaroid`                                                                     | the decorative chrome around the video element                           |

Read `<SKILL_DIR>/references/DESIGN_INDEX.md`
for the full matrix and a loose decision guide (interview / product launch / data analysis /
social clip / technical tutorial / emotional story …). When you decide to use a specific
style / layout / frame, Read the corresponding file:

- `references/styles/<key>.html` — self-contained card fragment with that
  style's CSS tokens (colors, fonts, padding, ornament) and a placeholder
  takeaway. Copy the `.card[data-card-id="ref-<key>"]` style block, rename
  the data-card-id to your card's id, swap the placeholder content for the
  real takeaway, and you're done.
- `references/layouts/<key>.html` — exact `videoBounds` + `cardBounds` for
  both landscape and portrait, with a copy-paste JSON snippet for
  `storyboard.json`'s per-card `layout` field.
- `references/frames/<key>.html` — decorative HTML to add as a sibling of
  `#video-wrap`, plus placement instructions for the composition CSS.

Pick `style × layout × frame` **per card** — you can change all three
between cards as long as the transitions read smoothly. A common rhythm:
open `editorial × overlay × clean`, switch to `audit × split × hairline`
for the data card, close on `whiteboard × pip × polaroid`.

The 10 styles are skill-side design tokens, **not composition-level themes** —
they don't need to be declared in `storyboard.composition`; they live
inside each card's HTML. The `themeId` field can still pick a
composition-level palette (table above) that controls page-body background
and video border chrome.

#### Layout Compositions (Card + Video)

Two coordinated decisions per card define how it shares the canvas with
the source video:

- **`card.zone`** (declared in `storyboard.json`) — one of the 5 schema
  values; resolve it into pixel bounds (per the table in Step 6) when
  you write the card-host wrapper's inline `style` in Step 9.
- **`#video-wrap` bounds at this card's time window** (declared
  imperatively in the composition's GSAP timeline) — the agent tweens
  `#video-wrap` to a target rect for each layout transition.

Schema does NOT store per-card video bounds. `videoTrack.bounds` is
**one-time** at composition level (defaults to full canvas). Video
"moving" between cards is purely a GSAP animation authored in
`index.html`. There is no `card.layout` field — earlier versions of this
doc invented one; the real schema only has `card.zone`.

**4 composition layouts** (from `references/layouts/`) — each is a
recipe pairing a `zone` with a `#video-wrap` tween target:

| composition layout | recommended `card.zone` | GSAP target for `#video-wrap` (landscape 1920×1080)                       | GSAP target for `#video-wrap` (portrait 1080×1920)                | when to use                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `split`            | `side-panel`            | `{ left: 960, top: 0, width: 960, height: 1080 }`                         | `{ left: 0, top: 960, width: 1080, height: 960 }` (bottom half)   | speaker + data side-by-side / 50:50 weight      |
| `stack`            | `lower-third`           | `{ left: 14, top: 14, width: 1892, height: 548 }` (top 52%)               | `{ left: 0, top: 0, width: 1080, height: 844 }` (top 44%)         | speaker on top + summary card below             |
| `pip`              | `fullscreen`            | `{ left: 1480, top: 760, width: 400, height: 300 }` + add `.framed` class | `{ left: 690, top: 28, width: 360, height: 203 }` + add `.framed` | content-heavy card + corner pip                 |
| `overlay`          | `video-overlay`         | `{ left: 0, top: 0, width: 1920, height: 1080 }` (full-bleed)             | `{ left: 0, top: 0, width: 1080, height: 1920 }`                  | cinematic / dramatic / glass card on full video |

For 4:5 (1080×1350), scale portrait y/h values by `1350/1920 ≈ 0.703`
(see Step 7.0 Channel A / Channel B `recommendedRatio` resolution
table).

**Other zone values for one-off variants** (still uses `card.zone`; no
fake "layout" field):

| `zone`            | resolved bounds                                        | common use                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `fullscreen`      | covers whole canvas                                    | hero card, video tweens to hidden/pip |
| `whiteboard-area` | inset 40px margin (landscape) or bottom 45% (portrait) | dense data card, free margins         |
| `lower-third`     | bottom 30% band                                        | talking-head annotation               |
| `side-panel`      | right 42% (landscape) or bottom 40% (portrait)         | sidebar / "split" recipe              |
| `video-overlay`   | full canvas; expect transparent card root              | glass overlay on full-bleed video     |

You can mix recipes per card — choose `card.zone` based on what suits
the moment, then write the GSAP tween for `#video-wrap` between cards.

#### Storyboard Render Contract

`storyboard.json` is an agent-internal planning artifact — no CLI
command parses it. It exists to keep your timing and content decisions
explicit before you write each card's HTML. Stick to the v3-style
shape below so the same outline drives the composition you assemble in
Step 9.

Required structure (see Step 6 for the full example):

- `schemaVersion: 3`
- `composition: { fps, width, height, durationSeconds, layout, themeId, seed }` — note `durationSeconds`/`fps`/`themeId`/`layout` live **inside** `composition`, NOT at top level
- `videoTrack: { sourcePath, startSec, endSec, bounds? }` — video bounds default to full canvas
- `subtitles: { enabled, ... }`
- `cards[]` — each card has the 6 required fields: `id`, `intent`, `startSec`, `endSec`, `accentIndex`, `zone`, `contentHints`

Rules:

- Card times stay inside `composition.durationSeconds` and should not overlap unless intentional (use `data-track-index` to control z-order when they do).
- Visual details live in card HTML fragments (Step 8), NOT in `contentHints`. `contentHints` is your own structured prompt for designing the card; the rendered look is the HTML.
- Keep the storyboard shape stable — even though nothing parses it, you read it back while authoring Step 8/9, and consistency keeps card IDs and timing in sync.
- Agent-side decisions like "I picked overlay × geom × clean" do NOT belong in `storyboard.json` — keep them in working memory and use them when authoring card HTML + GSAP tweens.

**Transparent card backgrounds for cards that share canvas with video.**
When the GSAP tween leaves video visible behind/beside the card (overlay
recipe, pip recipe, or any `card.zone = 'lower-third' | 'video-overlay'`
moment), the card's `.root` MUST NOT paint a full opaque background —
otherwise it occludes the video. Two patterns:

```css
/* Pattern A: transparent root, page body provides the cream backdrop */
html,
body {
  background: var(--bg);
}
.card[data-card-id="card-X"] .root {
  background: transparent;
}

/* Pattern B: explicit per-card background ONLY for fullscreen cards */
.card[data-card-id="card-hero"] .root {
  background: var(--bg);
}
.card[data-card-id="card-overlay"] .root {
  background: transparent;
}
```

For `side-panel`-zone cards (split recipe), the card-host is already
only half the canvas, so an opaque card bg is fine — it only covers its
half.
